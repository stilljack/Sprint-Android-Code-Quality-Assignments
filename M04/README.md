# Android UI Testing Calculator

For this app, you'll build the UI for a calculator using the same test driven design principles as before.

## Instructions

- Create a test in androidTest

- Add use cases for every user interaction you will support before you add UI to support it.

  - Build a test `shouldAdd9ToUI` then add a click event to the button to handle that (be sure to use the code you wrote in the Calculator class to do this)

- Build the XML for the UI

- Add minimal features first, get them working, then iterate. (Don't wait to build the entire calculator before testing.)

    

Remember, this calculator should have the following features:

- Add numbers (in the future, you'll add them with buttons 0-9), but for now, just call the methods manually
- Add a decimal to the current number (stretch: can you handle adding zeros past the decimal point?)
- Remove the most recently added character (backspace; stretch: handle this with decimal point!)
- Perform the following calculations
  - Addition
  - Subraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Stretch: Perform repeated calculations (5 * 10 = 50, pressing equals again should return 500, etc.)
- Clear all values

Be sure to add test cases for each use case on each feature before implementing that feature

#### Go Further
- Add other math functions to your calculator
- Use what we've learned about styles and themes to make the app look how you want it to.
